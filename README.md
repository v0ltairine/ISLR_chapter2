# ISLR_chapter2

This is my code from the lab and exercises from chapter 2 of Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (ames, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani, 2015). 
I am working through this book with a group that meets weekly to discuss the chapters, going over the concepts, helping each other with problems, and talking through the material to help us internalize it.  
This also includes all the notes to myself, as I work through the problems.
